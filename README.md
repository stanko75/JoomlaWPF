Front end and back end of Joomla! web portal in WPF version

This project is not planned to be finished. Idea is to learn  Microsoft Prism and Autofac. I will have front end and backend WPF version of Joomla! web portal.

All aplication have to be created with styles and user controles. Also, everything has to be accessed over the keyboard. 

### Front end ###

###### First region ######

First region will be on left side. It will contain tabs. First tab will be tree view representation of categories in MySql, second tab will be representation of same categories in a table, so that I can sort them by date, for example.

With Autofac I will fill tree view and table, using same model.

###### Second region ######

Second region will be in middle, and it will present content of an article which will be selected on the third region

###### Third region ######

It will have list of articles of categories which will be selected on first region.
